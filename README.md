#Pencil Me In

This is a solo project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta).

#Summary
Pencil Me In is an application for professionals who rely their daily practice based on a schedule.

#Problem
Most professionals rely on a personal schedule, that is not available to their clients. This may take more
work for their customers to contact that professional to find any openings and/or schedule an appointment.
Thus, sometimes the customer cannot afford the luxury of time and direct communication to the professional, and
avoid using those services all together.

#Solution
This application will provides access to a scheduling widget for both the professional and customer, by providing
the professional with private access to personal appointments and openings, as well as providing the their 
clients with an interface to view and schedule acceptable appointment slots.

#How to get started
Create an account, add open appointment slots, locate your unique link to provide to your clinets, enjoy!
